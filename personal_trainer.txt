Gym personal trainer virtual agent.

Idea: analyze user's training behaviour and nutrition patterns to automatically suggest meals/training variations/exercises
Features:
- history: store the user's workouts and meals in a database, to better cater to future needs
- Proactivity: for example it can send you an email if you miss your workout, or you forget to register it, (could also check based on your gym membership and duration of the visit), suggest new meals every week given your caloric goals, or order food. 
- Suggest improvements based on progress (if the progress is too small), change to a different exercise or weight to prevent plateaus.

UI:
web app with (optinally) a virtual agent resembling a human to increase antropomorphism and user engagement (to mimic video calls with personal trainers).
